## Objectives:
My main objective with this personal project was to learn how to a) create a webapp using react, and b) create a webapp that has both a frontend and backend. 
I decided to create a web app that finds doctors near a certain address largely because I wanted to learn how to use a google api and have some kind of practical use. Also this website will probably only run for about two more months because at that point the google api credit runs out. However ill probably attach some kind of video or image of what the website looks, how it works, etc...
Also this was my first foray into css and web styling.
